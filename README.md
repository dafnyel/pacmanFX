# PacmanFX

As part of my degree (MSc), I was asked to implement the Pacman game in Java.
I chose to use JavaFX for the matter and here is the result.

Few things to know before using this code:
- The code is not so well written due to a relativly small time frame.
- There are some bugs, but the game is very much playable.
- The code in this project by any means does not reflect my coding skills, I used a foreign language (I'm a JS dev) to me.
- I truly believe that using JS would end up with third of the code, in half of the time.
- This leads me to the conclution that Java is way behind and not suitable to rapid development.


Enjoy.
